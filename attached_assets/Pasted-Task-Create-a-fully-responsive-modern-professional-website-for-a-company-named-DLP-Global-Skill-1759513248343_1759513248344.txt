Task:
Create a fully responsive, modern, professional website for a company named “DLP Global Skillers Solutions” using React (with TypeScript preferred), Framer Motion, React Three Fiber (for 3D elements/hero section), GSAP animations, Glassmorphism & Neumorphism styles, and a global theme system.

Requirements

Global Theme & Layout

Use a global theme provider for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, etc.

Font family: modern sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or Montserrat).

Responsive typography → font size and spacing should adjust based on screen width.

Dark + light mode support (optional but preferred).

Smooth transitions when switching pages (Framer Motion page transitions).

Maintain consistent glassmorphism for navbars/cards and neumorphism for buttons/interactive elements.

Sticky, semi-transparent with glassmorphism effect.

Glassmorphism:

Responsiveness

Mobile-first approach.

Collapse navbar into a hamburger menu on smaller screens (animated with Framer Motion).

Grid → stacked layout on smaller screens.

Font sizes, spacing, and 3D elements scale down gracefully.

Additional Notes

Clean folder structure (components/, pages/, animations/, theme/, etc.).

Use reusable UI components (Button, Card, Section, Navbar, Footer).

Keep animations subtle and professional (not overwhelming).

Ensure accessibility (semantic HTML, proper aria labels, alt tags).
